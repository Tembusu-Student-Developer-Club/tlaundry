# tLaundry Project - Developer Guide

## Current Status

The Python script has been tested a year ago, but with the discontinuation of the tlaundry2 database, another round of testing with the new database (tlaundry3 database) needs to be done.

The script currently only supports the machines on Tembusu College Level 9. Once the functionality of the system has been verified, we plan to extend the script to cover the machines on Tembusu College Level 17 as well.

As of December 2021, there are no other outstanding issues with the script aside from the above.

## Future Plans

The current script handles the detection in a manner such that there are only two possible states for the machines: "in-use" and "available". 

A possible improvment is to expand on the detection system such that we are able to provide the users with the precise amount of time left for the machine to complete its task.
